# Linear Regression Model

Problem given - In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

According to the problem we have created a Linear Regression Model.

Steps performed in the project - 
1) Store and plot the data
2) Seperate Data (train,test)
3) Perform Linear regression operations
4) Prediction part

These all are the steps we have performed and you can find these in the code.

Libraries Used -
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
sklearn

Data set is provided in the dataset section.
